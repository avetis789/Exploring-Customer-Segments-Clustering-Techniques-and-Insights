Exploring Customer Segments: Clustering Techniques and Insights

Overview:
This project analyzes approximately 2240 purchasing decisions to identify distinct customer segments using advanced clustering techniques. The analysis aims to understand buying patterns and customer behavior across different product categories. This repository contains both the analysis and findings using K-Means, Agglomerative, and Gaussian Mixture clustering algorithms.

Research Question:
How can clustering algorithms be utilized to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing patterns in different product categories?

Data:
The dataset comprises purchasing decisions from various customers segmented by different algorithms into five clusters. The data includes information such as income, total spending, and tenure. A detailed analysis of buying patterns is provided, utilizing the Apriori algorithm to unearth associations between product purchases.

Key Findings:
Clustering Efficiency: After evaluating different algorithms, K-Means exhibited the highest silhouette score of 0.535, demonstrating well-defined cluster boundaries.

Buying Patterns:
There is a strong positive correlation between income, total spending, and months enrolled with total spending.
On average, postgraduates with no children and living alone spend more.
Wines and meats categories show significant positive correlation.
99.4% of customers purchasing wines also bought meats, highlighting a strong cross-selling opportunity.

Profit Analysis:
Wines contribute significantly to total sales, making over 70% more profit than meats, the next best-selling category.

Customer Insights:
High spenders and Highest spenders spend more in all categories but especially so in wine and meats.
Consistent patrons and average spenders frequently participate in deals and campaigns.

Clustering Details:
The analysis formed five distinct customer segments:
Highest Spenders
High Spenders
Consistent Patrons
Average Spender
Lowest Spenders
Each group is analyzed based on income, total spending, and tenure, revealing unique purchasing habits and preferences.

Visualizations:
The project includes various visual aids such as heatmaps of income quartiles against total spending in product categories, providing intuitive insights into customer behavior.

Conclusion:
This analysis effectively delineates customer segments, providing a robust basis for targeted marketing strategies. It confirms the potential for targeted campaigns, especially in promoting wine and meat product combinations to high spenders and highest spenders.

Targeted Sales Strategies:
Deals and Campaigns: Aim at consistent patrons and average spenders who show higher acceptance rates.
Premium Product Promotion: Focus on high and highest spenders for promoting premium categories like wines, often in combination with meats.
